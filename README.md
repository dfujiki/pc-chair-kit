# PC Chair Kit
This is a kit to make PC chairs lives less painful.

This code was written for ISCA-18 by Mario Drumond and Mark Sutherland under the guidance of Babak Falsafi. We used code from the ISCA 17 and Micro 17. The code is still in a crude state, and we will clean it out in the near future.

They can be used for the following tasks:
* Conflict of interest management.
* Paper assignments.
* Various nagging tasks (prepare to nag a lot to your PCs about missed deadlines and ignored guidelines).
* Managing ranking information (disclosing it to reviewers, ranking papers using PC ranks, etc.)
* Meeting management (if for some reason you can't use HotCRP's awesome meeting tracker).
* Conflict of interest management for TOT awards.

To start, run:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt [--user]
```
## Conflict of interest (COI) management
We check COIs flagged by authors, PC members and we also automatically generate a list of recent co-authors for all PC members using DBLP data. All conflict data can be entered in HotCRP through he `Assignment` page.

The workflow for checking/flagging COIs between papers and PC members is the following:
1. Generate a `.csv` with a list of the PC members, with their first and last names. This list has to be manually generated, and it has the following format:
```
id, first_name, last_name, email
1, PCFirstName1, PCLastName1, PCEmail
```

2. Use the first list as an input to DBLP crawler. To do so, run:
```bash
python3 dblp_crawler.py author-keys --author-list AUTHOR_LIST_FILE --author-keys AUTHOR_KEYS_FILE
```
This command will generate another CSV file in `AUTHOR_KEYS_FILE` which has all the DBLP keys that matched the author names. Your job now is to go through that file and filter out all the bad entries (i.e., homonyms). You can do that by removing the `x` in the `valid` column of `AUTHOR_KEYS_FILE`.

3. Generate the paper list from the author-keys file. To do so, run:
```bash
python3 dblp_crawler.py paper-list --author-keys AUTHOR_KEYS_FILE --paper-list PAPER_LIST_FILE
```
This command will generate another CSV file in `PAPER_LIST_FILE` with all the papers authored by each PC member. Your job now is to go through that file and filter out all the bad entries (i.e., papers that do not constitute COI with co-authors), the same way you filtered out the author keys. ~~After filtering this file, add another column to the file (1st column) with the PC emails. Excel helps to perform this task.~~

4. Generate the co-author list from the paper list. To do so, run:
```bash
python3 dblp_crawler.py list-co-authors --paper-list PAPER_LIST_FILE
```
This command will warm up the paper cache so that every time you read from this list, you won't have to query it from DBLP. As you might notice, querying DBLP takes a long time.

5. Download and clean paper information from HotCRP. Go to HotCRP and download all the paper info. Search for all submitted papers, and, on the bottom of the page, click `select all`, and, in the drop-down list, select `JSON`, and click go. You will get a JSON file. In that file, you need to clean up all the information. For every paper, make sure that the COI list (collaborators) is in the following form:
```
Institution1 \n
All (Institution1) \n
AuthorFirstName AuthorLastName, Instutution2 \n
```
The scripts will interpret everything that does not have a `,` or a `(` before the end of the line as an institution name, and everything else as an author name. Make sure there is no line with multiple institutions/authors. The scripts will ignore authors institutions. Therefore, it is enough to end author names with a `,` to make sure the script will recognize them. Keep an eye on names that are common and short, as the cause lots of trouble when matching strings. For the author list, make sure that, for authors with multiple affiliations, you list all the affiliations in the `collaborators` field, as the scripts won't be able to recognize multiple affiliations.

Cleaning up submission data is a time consuming and error prone task, therefore, make sure you have the time to do it. Do not create any deadlines shortly after the submission deadline, as you might find yourself spending days parsing through bad author data. To aid in this task, you can use the `collab_format_checker.py` script, that looks for suspicious entries in the collaborator fields. Look at the script for more details.

6. Download and clean PC data. Go to HotCRP `User` page and select the PC. On the bottom of the page, click on `select all` and download `PC info`.

7. Cross check all conflicts. You can do so by running:
```bash
python3 cross_reference_conflcits.py INSTITUTIONS_CSV PAPER_DATA PC_INFO PC_PAPERS OUT_PROPER_CONFLICTS PAPER_COLLABS_FIELD_CONFLICTS PC_COLLABS_FIELD_CONFLICTS DBLP_COLLABS_FIELD_CONFLICTS SUSPICIOUS_CONFLICTS
```

This script takes the following inputs:
* **INSTITUTIONS_CSV** CSV file with a list of institutions and their aliases. We added ours to this repo, in `data/institutions.csv`, and you can add institutions to that file as you see fit.
* **PAPER_DATA** The `.json` file you downloaded and cleaned with the paper info.
* **PC_INFO** The `.csv` file you downloaded and cleaned with the PC info
* **PC_PAPERS** The `.csv` file you generated and filtered with the list of PC papers.
* **OUT_PROPER_CONFLICTS** The output file with the proper conflicts (the conflicts flagged by authors in the submission form.
* **OUT_PAPER_COLLABS_FIELD_CONFLICTS** The output file with conflicts that are detected by checking the paper collabs field of the submission
* **OUT_PC_COLLABS_FIELD_CONFLICTS** The output file with conflicts that are detected by checking the paper collabs field of the PCs
* **OUT_DBLP_COLLABS_FIELD_CONFLICTS** The output file with conflicts that are detected through DBLP
* **OUT_SUSPICIOUS_CONFLICTS** The output file with conflicts that are flagged by authors but can't be checked elsewhere

Check the outputs for bad conflicts. Bad conflicts are normally from common names and very short names.
After you double check the conflicts csvs, clearing the 'valid' column of the conflicts that are incorrect, you can generate the '.csv' that will be used by HotCRP:

```bash
python3 report_to_csv OUT_REPORT_CSV OUT_HOTCRP_CSV
```

You can upload this conflicts from the `Assignment` page in HotCRP.

## Paper assignments
Paper assignment is a difficult task because both PC members and paper authors are inconsistent when listing their topics of interest. We build some infrastructure to aid in this task.

The script `paper_affinity.py` Generates affinity reports based on an expertise DB and the number of citation made from paper to PC members. The intuition is that papers that cite a particular PC member a lot should be reviewed by that PC member. 

#### Generating the citation reports

First, you have to generate a citation report. You will need to download `pdftotext` to do so. After you downloaded `pdftotext`, download all the pdfs from HotCRP and place them in a folder `PDF_FOLDER`. Copy the contents of `WordCnt_And_Reference_Logger` to `PDF_FOLDER` and, from that folder run:
```
./wordscript.sh
```

#### Generating affinity reports

With the citation report, run:
```bash
python3 paper_affinity.py --expertise-db EXPERTISE_DB --paper-json PAPER_DATA --pc-csv PC_INFO --expertise-to-topics EXPERTISE_TO_TOPICS --submissions PDF_FOLDER --out-pc-topics OUT_PC_TOPICS --out-pc-citations OUT_PC_CITATIONS --out-affinity OUT_AFFINITY
```
Where:
* **EXPERTISE_DB** list of authors expertises in the format:
```
id,First Name,Last Name,email,[comma separated list of expertises]
id1,PCMcmberFirstName1,PCMcmberLastName1,email,[list of expertises with `1` if the pc member is an expert and nothing otherwhise
```
* **PAPER_DATA** The `.json` file you donwloaded and cleaned with the paper info.
* **PC_INFO** The `.csv` file you you downloaded and cleaned with the PC info
* **EXPERTISE_TO_TOPICS** A file that maps PC expertise to paper topics, in case they differ. An expertise can map to one or more topic, and a single topic can map to many expertises. This file has the format:
```
Expertise,Topic,,,,,,,,,,,
Expertise1,Topic1,Topic2,Topic3
```
* **PDF_FOLDER** Folder where papers are located
* **OUT_PC_TOPICS** PC topic reports.
* **OUT_PC_CITATIONS** PC citation reports.
* **OUT_AFFINITY** PC affinity reports.
